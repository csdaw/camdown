## Dependencies

- Need to install `bslib` and `downlit` packages to use `bookdown::bs4_book`
output.

## Class options

- Still need to add: abstract, draft? (maybe), customfont

## Chapter mode

Steps: 

1. Set chapter: true
2. Add chapter Rmd files you want to knit to _bookdown.yaml
3. Optionally, add `\setcounter{chapter}{x}` to before the chapter heading to
set the chapter number that you want, where x is the chapter number you want
minus 1 i.e. use x = 2 when you want chapter 3.
