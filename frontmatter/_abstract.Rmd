The `camdown` template is for writing a University of Cambridge thesis.
The template draws heavily from Ulrik Lyngs' excellent `oxforddown` template, 
and relies upon the `PhDThesisPSnPDF` \LaTeX\ class written by Krishna Kumar.

The template's sample content is based on `oxforddown` and 
describes how to write a thesis in R markdown using *R Markdown* and `bookdown`. 
I hope `camdown` proves easy to use and will help future University of 
Cambridge students move toward producing open and reproducible research.
