I am grateful
for Yihui Xie for creating `knitr`, `rmarkdown`, `bookdown`,  and `tinytex`
amongst many other software packages which I use on on a daily basis. To 
Krishna Kumar I give many thanks for creating the CUED PhD thesis \LaTeX\ template 
upon which this template relies. I am also grateful for Chester Ismay and his
`thesisdown` package which inspired many people including myself to write their
theses in *R Markdown*. Lastly, I would like to thank Ulrik Lyngs, 
whose `oxforddown` template is the basis and inspiration for this thesis template.
