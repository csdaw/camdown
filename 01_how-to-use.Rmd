# How to use

## How `camdown` is structured

### index.Rmd

In index.Rmd you set your thesis' basic metadata (e.g. title, author, 
college, etc.). Optional fields have been commented out.

```{yaml}
title: |
  `oxforddown`: \
  An Oxford University Thesis \
  Template for R Markdown
# subtitle: 'Subtitle'
author: 'Author Name'
dept: 'Department Name'
university: 'University of Cambridge'
university-crest: 'figures/crests/university_crest'
university-crest-width: '0.3\textwidth'
college: 'College Name'
# college-shield: 'figures/crests/Downing'
# college-shield-width: '0.2\textwidth'
# supervisor: 'Prof. A.B. Supervisor'
# supervisor-role: '**Supervisor: **'
# supervisor-linewidth: '0.35\textwidth'
# advisor: 'Dr. A. Advisor'
# advisor-role: '**Advisor: **'
# advisor-linewidth: '0.25\textwidth'
degree-title: 'Doctor of Philosophy'
date: 'September 2021'
```

Then you add the text for your dedication, declaration, acknowledgements,
and abstract. Here we just paste the text from some **.Rmd** files which 
should be placed in the **frontmatter/** folder. Alternatively, you can just
write the text by hand into **index.Rmd**.

```{yaml}
dedication: |
  `r paste(readLines("frontmatter/_dedication.Rmd"), collapse = '\n  ')`
declaration:  |
  `r paste(readLines("frontmatter/_declaration.Rmd"), collapse = '\n  ')`
acknowledgements: |
  `r paste(readLines("frontmatter/_acknowledgements.Rmd"), collapse = '\n  ')`
abstract: |
  `r paste(readLines("frontmatter/_abstract.Rmd"), collapse = '\n  ')`
```
